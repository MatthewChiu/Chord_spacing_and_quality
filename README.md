# Chord_spacing_and_quality

Theory: Per music theorists' use of the DFT, chord elicit particular "qualities." These DFTs are most often calculated on pitch-classes (notes mapped to their 12 note names), but cognitive researhc (Kuusi 2005) has shown that the spacing of chords also impact perception. <br> <br>

Project: Borrowing from research in audio engineering, our initial paper made a methodological connection between the Cepstrum (or DFT on log DFT signal) and a DFT on pitch (as opposed to pitch class) data. We study the model and how it relates to PC models and listener perception. <br> <br>

This project is a collaboration with Noah Kahrs.
